1) Example #1
NST Team
1. ordering of the transitions: chat #4  than new event #7 settings chat screen #9;
2. where does sharing lists window come from?!;
3. screen #12 button “Ok” what does it do?;
4. sharing list window confusing;

2) Two benefits of doing A2 screens:
1.VSUALIZATION!!!
We are working in team, and we have different views on how should look our project. That is why to come to a consensus we need to build our prototype;
2.To Avoid “narrow” points of our project 
to make sure that UI is obvious, and demonstrate all use cases belonging to all the actors.
